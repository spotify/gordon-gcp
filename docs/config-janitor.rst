Configuration
=============

Configuring Google Cloud Platform :doc:`plugins` for the `gordon-janitor`_ service.

Example Configuration
---------------------

An example of a ``gordon-janitor.toml`` file for GCP-specific plugins:

.. literalinclude:: ../gordon-janitor.toml.example
    :language: ini


Plugin Configuration
--------------------

The following sections are supported:


gcp
~~~

Any configuration key/value listed here may also be used in the specific plugin configuration. Values set in a plugin-specific config section will overwrite what's set in this general ``[gcp]`` section.

.. option:: keyfile="/path/to/keyfile.json"

    `Required`: Path to the Service Account JSON keyfile to use while authenticating against Google APIs.

    While one global key for all plugins is supported, it's advised to create a key per plugin with only the permissions it requires. To setup a service account, follow `Google's docs on creating & managing service account keys <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys>`_.

    .. attention::

        For the Pub/Sub plugin, ``keyfile`` is not required when running against the `Pub/Sub Emulator <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator>`_ that Google provides.

.. option:: project="STR"

    `Required`: Google Project ID which hosts the relevant GCP services (e.g. Cloud DNS, Pub/Sub, Compute Engine).

    To learn more about GCP projects, please see `Google's docs on creating & managing projects <https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects>`_.

.. option:: scopes=["STR","STR"]

    `Optional`: A list of strings of the scope(s) needed when making calls to Google APIs. Defaults to ``["cloud-platform"]``.

.. option:: cleanup_timeout=INT

    `Optional`: Timeout in seconds for how long each plugin should wait for outstanding tasks (e.g. processing remaining message from a channel) before cancelling. This is only used when a plugin has received all messages from a channel, but may have work outstanding. Defaults to ``60``.


gcp.gdns
~~~~~~~~

All configuration options above in the general ``[gcp]`` may be used here. There are no specific DNS-related configuration options.

gcp.gpubsub
~~~~~~~~~~~

All configuration options above in the general ``[gcp]`` may be used here. Additional Google Cloud Pub/Sub-related configuration is needed:

.. option:: topic="STR"

    `Required`: Google Pub/Sub topic to receive the publish change messages.

.. attention::

    For the Pub/Sub plugin, ``keyfile`` is not required when running against the `Pub/Sub Emulator <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator>`_ that Google provides.


gcp.gce
~~~~~~~

All configuration options from the general ``[gcp]`` section may be used here.

Additional plugin-specific configuration is needed:

.. option:: zone="STR"

    `Required`: ID of a Cloud DNS managed zone that instance resource records should belong to.

.. option:: metadata_blackklist=[["STR","STR"],["STR","STR"]]

    `Optional`: List of key-value pairs that will be used to filter out unwanted GCE instances by `instance metadata <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata>`_. Note that both the key and the value must match for an instance to be filtered out.

.. option:: tag_blacklist=["STR","STR"]

    `Optional`: List of `network tags <https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags>`_  that will be used to filter out unwanted GCE instances.

.. option:: project_blacklist=["STR","STR"]

    `Optional`: List of unique, user-assigned project IDs (``projectId``) that will be ignored when fetching projects.

.. option:: instance_filter="STR"

    `Optional`: String used to filter instances by instance attributes. It is passed directly to GCE's `v1.instances.aggregatedList <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/aggregatedList>`_ endpoint's `filter` parameter.
