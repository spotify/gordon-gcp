Module to compare desired record sets produced from a Resource Authority
(i.e. ``GCEInstanceAuthority`` for Google Compute Engine) and actual
record sets from Google Cloud DNS, then publish corrective messages to
the internal ``changes_channel`` if there are differences.

This client makes use of the asynchronous DNS client as defined in
:class:`.GDNSClient`, and therefore must use service account/JWT
authentication (for now).

See :doc:`config-janitor` for the required Google DNS configuration.

.. attention::

    This reconciler client is an internal module for the core janitor
    logic. No other use cases are expected.

To use:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import gordon_gcp

    config = {
        'keyfile': '/path/to/keyfile.json',
        'project': 'a-dns-project'
    }
    rrset_chnl = asyncio.Queue()
    changes_chnl = asyncio.Queue()

    reconciler = gordon_gcp.GDNSReconciler(
        config, rrset_chnl, changes_chnl)

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    try:
        loop.run_until_complete(reconciler.start())
    finally:
        loop.close()
