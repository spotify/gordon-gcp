Client module to publish any required DNS changes initiated from
:class:`.GDNSReconciler` to `Google Cloud Pub/Sub <https://cloud.
google.com/pubsub/docs/overview>`_. The consumer of these messages is
the `Gordon service <https://github.com/spotify/gordon>`_.

This client wraps around `google-cloud-pubsub <https://pypi.python.org
/pypi/google-cloud-pubsub>`_ using `grpc <https://github.com/googleapis/
googleapis/blob/master/google/pubsub/v1/pubsub.proto>`_ rather than
inheriting from :class:`.AIOConnection`.

.. attention::

    This publisher client is an internal module for the core janitor
    logic. No other use cases are expected.


To use:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import gordon_gcp

    config = {
        'keyfile': '/path/to/keyfile.json',
        'project': 'a-dns-project',
        'topic': 'a-topic',
    }
    changes_channel = asyncio.Queue()

    publisher = gordon_gcp.get_gpubsub_publisher(
        config, changes_channel)

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    try:
        loop.run_until_complete(publisher.start())
    finally:
        loop.close()
